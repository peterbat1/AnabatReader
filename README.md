Development of an Anabat data file reader was undertaken by
Peter D. Wilson between 11 and 17 December 2013. I can be contacted by
email: peterbat1_at_tpg.com.au (replace _at_ with the ASCII "at" symbol, of course.)

This R script implements and extends earlier software (now lost in unfortunate
circumstances) written by me in Borland Delphi between 2003 and 2011.

This code (like its lost predecessor) is based on the comprehensive notes on
Anabat file formats and how to read them, including example C++ code, provided
by Chris Corben on his website:
